## The app and its features

The name CONFIND is coined from the word COUNTRYFINDER. The idea behind this application is to create an easy to use application that shows list of countries where the user can search, filter the countries by its region and time zones.
The app allows both the landscape and portrait orientation. The homescreen has a search button at the top which is used to search for countries and under it is the language and filter button. With the language button the user can change to any specific language he or she wants while with the filter button the user can edit search he/she wants, The filter button is implemented with the continent and time zones.
The next section is a list of the countries generated by the api from a-z, With a pressable that can navigate to the details of the pressed country.
